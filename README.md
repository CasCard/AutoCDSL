# AutoCDSL is now Free !

**The problem** : Usually, once you authorize the stock for debit with CDSL using TPIN, the authorizations will remain valid only for one day. This means you have to re-authorize the stock with CDSL TPIN in case the sell transaction didn't complete on the same day. Since it is a daily grind for retail investors and sometimes we might be left out causing us not able to sell stocks and stock also might get reversed while completing authorization. 
Also, remembering the TPIN and entering the OTP number can also be a tedious process. To overcome all these problems, AutoCDSL will be of great help.

## How **AutoCDSL** can save **24hr** in your life in a year ?

There are 253 trading days in a year
Imagine you take 6 min every day to perform this OTP authentication

**253*6** = **1513** minutes

**1513/60** = **25.3** hours (more than a day)

lol ! Thus automation can save **a day**.

Thanks for the huge support for the project !
